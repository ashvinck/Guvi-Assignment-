Write about objects and its internal representation in JavaScript.




Objects are one of the most important data structures in JavaScript.Objects lets us store data about a particular thing and helps us to keep track of the data by using a key.
        Object Literal Notation  =>   { Key : Value , }   


        Objects  have 1) Properties 
                               2) Methods
     
 In simple words,  Properties are those things that contain information about  the object.
Methods are functions or capabilities that an object has.


We can create objects in two ways in JavaScript :
1. By creating an instance of Object directly (using a  new keyword).
2. By object literal.


By creating an instance of Object directly ( using a new keyword). 
                  
                   let  objectname  = new Object ();
	

             Here the new keyword is used to create a new object.




By object literal    






var myObj = {
colour : “Orange”,
shape : “sphere”,
type : ”food”,
eat : function () {
return “yummy”
                                                            } 
                                                            };


myObj.eat(); //method
myObj.colour; //property
          
	Accessing Objects can be done  by objectName.property. Or objectName[“property”].
